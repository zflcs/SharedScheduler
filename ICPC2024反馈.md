Dear Fangliang,

The reviews are in and after brief discussions, clarification questions 
have been raised to help the reviewers make their decision. Some 
reviewers preferred to put their concerns in the review itself, while 
others have explicitly stated questions that are ranked in order of 
their priority.

We will now leave the submission site open for the author's response 
until

** Tuesday, December 19, 2023 AoE **.

Please make sure you select the checkbox that the rebuttal is ready for 
review.

Important points about the authors’ response:

1. Authors' responses are optional, though providing a response will 
enable reviewers to consider and discuss the information you provide in 
the response when making the final decision for a paper.

2. If you choose to respond, we recommend starting the authors’ response 
by addressing any factual errors or misunderstandings in the reviews, 
followed by answering the questions raised by reviewers in the 
“Questions for authors’ response” sections (if there are any) and 
addressing major concerns that the reviewers raised in their reviews.

3. The review process remains double-anonymous. Please do *not* provide 
additional links or clues that can disclose your identity, as doing so 
could result in the rejection of your paper.

4. Unless specifically asked for by reviewers, the authors' response 
cannot include any new research results (e.g., additional experimental 
results) that are not in the original submission.

5. While you can provide a response longer than 750 words, reviewers are 
not required to read beyond the first 750 words of your response (though 
they can choose to);  thus, be sure to start your response with the most 
important answers and arguments. Words beyond the limit will be 
highlighted by the HotCRP submission system.

Best wishes,

Kevin Moran and Olga Baysal
ICPC 2024 Program Co-Chairs

Review #59A
===========================================================================

Overall merit
-------------
1. Reject

Reviewer expertise
------------------
2. Some familiarity

Paper summary
-------------
The paper introduces SharedScheduler, a new concurrency model designed to address the limitations of traditional multi-threading in high-concurrency applications. It utilizes a priority-based coroutine model, offering improved throughput and reduced overhead. The model includes a unified scheduling framework for both kernel-space and user-space coroutines and leverages kernel coroutines for asynchronous I/O operations. Extensive experiments on an FPGA-based system demonstrate SharedScheduler's significantly higher throughput (one to four times) and lower overhead compared to traditional multi-threading models in large concurrency applications.

Strengths
---------
The paper is well organized, presented, and the experiments were conducted extensively.

Weaknesses
----------
My principal concern regarding this submission pertains to its alignment with the overarching theme of ICPC. The topic appears to be more apt for submission to a conference focused on Operating Systems, rather than ICPC.

Review #59B
===========================================================================

Overall merit
-------------
1. Reject

Reviewer expertise
------------------
2. Some familiarity

Paper summary
-------------
The paper presents a design for supporting highly concurrent applications combining coroutines (at user level) with threads (at kernel level).

Strengths
---------
May be an interesting OS structure.

Weaknesses
----------
Totally unrelated to program comprehension.

Comments for authors
--------------------
The paper is very technical. It describes a design straddling the user-kernel interface for supporting concurrency in applications. This may have interest in an OS/runtime/programming context. But even in such a context you can do better. For example, if you title this work a "scheduler" there should be some discussion on how scheduling decisions are made, not only on how they are implemented. The evaluation is also rather limited being based on a single static application.

But the paper's worse drawback is that it simply has nothing to do with this conference. It should go to a venue related to systems implementations.

And just a couple of typos I noticed:
In figure 2, the schedule and yield arrows between ready and running are reversed.
Line 651 server server.

Review #59C

3. Knowledgeable

Paper summary
-------------
The paper proposes a coroutine-based scheduling framework, termed SharedScheduler, to enhance operating system efficiency. It diverges from the traditional multi-threading approach due to two main challenges highlighted by the authors: (1) the non-deterministic execution order of the traditional multi-threading model and (2) the incompatibility of the traditional multi-threading paradigm with asynchronous I/O mechanisms in the OS. The authors maintain that while an event-driven approach can improve I/O efficiency, it complicates OS design and implementation. As an alternative, the authors introduce a coroutine-based scheduling framework, focusing on the OS, as an alternative to both multi-threading and event-driven approaches.

The authors utilize Rust stackless coroutines to construct the SharedScheduler framework, aiming to replace the traditional multithreading approach. They validate this framework against the multithreading approach, demonstrating that the SharedScheduler outperforms multithreading in terms of throughput and latency.

Strengths
---------
+ Clear description of the problem

+ Detailed description of the approach

+ Well-founded validation of the work

Weaknesses
----------
- Absence of a related work section

 - Insufficient Background Context

 - Unclear validation discussion

Comments for authors
--------------------
Below are more detailed comments about the weaknesses of the paper:

- Absence of a related work section: The manuscript lacks a dedicated section discussing related works, which is pivotal for establishing the distinctive contributions and positioning of this study in relation to existing approaches and advancements in the field.

 - Insufficient Background Context: Given that the paper relies on existing technology like coroutines and Rust, a dedicated background section on coroutines and their specific relevance, especially in enhancing software system efficiency, would be beneficial.

 - Unclear validation discussion: The presentation of the validation results suffers from ambiguity, especially concerning naming conventions. Additionally, the graphical representations in Figure 5 could be improved by adjusting the color schemes to distinctly represent the four models being compared, thereby enhancing the comprehensibility of the findings.

Other minor issues:
In lines 15 - 19, consider linking the two sentences: "we design a priority-based coroutine ... (line 15) and We design a unified priority-based ... (line 18). Also, in line 15, we design ... -> We design .

Lines 78 - 79: Incomplete sentence - Another case is that the I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) in the Windows OS.

The word preceived is used at different parts of the paper. If it is a typo, then correct it; otherwise, explain what the term means when used first.

Line 227: The compiler compilers -> The compiler compiles

Line 523: "After analyzing, ..." After analyzing what ? Or after the analysis.

Line 721: KCUT vs KCUT
