Summary: This paper proposes COPS, a coroutine-based priority scheduling framework for high concurrency scenarios. Specifically, COPS explicitly employs a priority-based coroutine model as the funndamental task unit, integrates coroutines within the kernel, and designs a priority-based scheduling framework. The experiments are conducted on a FPGA device and the results show that COPS can improve throughput while maintaining low overhead.

Details: 1. This manuscript is well-organized and well-writen. Even a researcher who is not familiar with coroutine can figure out the key design of this manuscript. 2. The section of related work should be further expanded to include more related literatures. Comparisons with COPS and existing work should also be summarised. 3. The technology challenges faced by COPS should be elaborated in Section I. 4. Please consider merging Section II with Section VI. 5. The experiments of this manuscript is adequate, but the results (e.g., Figures 6 and 7) should be in larger font.

Summary: The paper introduces COPS, a coroutine-based priority scheduling framework, which shows promise in improving the performance of high-concurrency applications. It provides a unified approach to coroutine scheduling and demonstrates significant performance benefits over traditional multi-threading models.

Details: Good points: - The innovative concept of COPS addresses a critical gap in high-concurrency application management. - The performance improvements demonstrated are substantial and well-documented, highlighting the potential of COPS in real-world applications. - The unified scheduling framework could simplify development efforts and enhance system-wide performance. - The priority-based scheduling is a thoughtful addition that can improve response times for critical tasks. - The prototype implementation and extensive evaluation add credibility to the proposed model. Weak points: - The performance evaluation is limited to an FPGA-based system, which may not reflect performance across diverse environments. - More details on resource management under high-load scenarios would be beneficial, particularly regarding fairness and preventing resource starvation. - The paper presents an innovative concurrency model, COPS, which is a commendable contribution. However, the paper should more clearly delineate how COPS differentiates from and outperforms existing technologies such as epoll and IOCP. - While performance metrics are provided, there is a lack of direct comparison with existing concurrency models. Including performance benchmarks against current models such as multi-threading or event-driven models would be beneficial.

Summary: The authors investigated a coroutine-based priority scheduling framework COPS, and based on COPS, they designed a web server. In the case studied, the throughput is increased by 4x.

Details: Genenally, the paper has merits and is easy to follow. + Experiments are conducted and interesting results are provided. + Problem is stated clearly and well motivated. - Related work is too short. I strongly suggest the authors, if accepted for publication, expand the related work section to provide a more comprehensive review of the literature.

Summary: In this paper COPS is presented. It is a coroutine-based priority scheduling framework, which allows the operating system to perceive user-level coroutines through a priority bitmap mechanism. COPS integrates coroutines with asynchronous I/O mechanisms. It also improves high context switching overhead and tries to solve the problem of uncertain sequence of accessing shared resources.

Details: The paper focuses on well-known issues concerning with multi-threading managed by OSs. In particular, it dusts off coroutines to implement a framework able to facilitate the development of highly concurrent applications, reduce the overhead of traditional multi-threading, and provide efficient asynchronous I/O and priority scheduling ... The paper sounds good and is well-written, even though the basic ideas reported in it are well known in the literature ... The experimental section shows good results.... however, further tests should be conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework...
