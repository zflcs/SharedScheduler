# COPS

COPS is a new concurrency model. It employs a priority-based coroutine model as the fundamental task unit, replacing the traditional multi-threading model in scenarios with high concurrency, and offers a unified priority-based scheduling framework for both kernel and user space coroutines.

It was accepted at [CIT-2024](https://smartconf24.org/cit2024/).
