# Abstract

As a classical concurrency model, multi-threading technology has been widely supported by numerous operating systems and extensively applied in various application programs. However, as concurrency increases, the high system overhead and context-switching costs of multi-threading model have gradually become unacceptable. As a result, coroutines have emerged, but they often only have been supported by user-level  and are not recognized by the operating system, which led to the inability of the kernel to  estimate the workload of coroutine tasks in the system accurately to perform more precise scheduling strategy to achieve higher system resource utilization. Based on the above situation, we have carried out the following work: 1) We have taken coroutines as the basic unit of kernel scheduling and implemented more precise scheduling to enhance the overall resource utilization.2) And we have designed an $O(1)$ complexity priority scheduling algorithm that cleverly unifies coroutine scheduling and process scheduling.3) We have used user-level interrupts to asynchronously transform system calls, improving the efficiency of waking up asynchronous coroutines. We have compared the efficiency of the thread model and the coroutine model on Qemu and FPGA, and found that coroutines have much lower overhead than threads in terms of context switching. Meanwhile, we also demonstrated the efficient utilization and precise allocation of system resources in the coroutine model through priority experiments.

# 1. Introduction

As of 2022, Google's servers are [handling 893 billion requests per day](./bibtex_ref/google10search), with an average of 8 million requests per second, posing a great challenge for both hardware and software. Handling such a large number of asynchronous requests cannot be supported solely by threads. In addition, as resource-constrained embedded devices become [increasingly commonplace in various fields](./bibtex_ref/mahbub2020iot) such as agriculture, education, and healthcare, low-cost abstractions in operating systems are becoming increasingly important. In scenarios with high concurrency or resource constraints, the industry has provided some solutions in both operating systems and programming languages. 

In the early days, Linux provided system calls such as [select and epoll](./bibtex_ref/epoll) to support user-level asynchronous I/O tasks by multiplexing multiple I/O operations on a single thread. The epoll operation uses a single thread to poll multiple listening ports, and when no event occurs, the polling operation will cause the polling thread to be block until an event arrives and wakes it up.  When an event occurs, the polling thread will copy the corresponding listening port from kernel space and send it to a separate thread for event processing. Windows [I/O Completion Ports (IOCP)](./bibtex_ref/IOCP) also provide a similar mechanism for I/O multiplexing. Unlike Linux, Windows IOCP calls the callback function in the completion thread for post-processing work after the completion of an I/O operation, making it a truly asynchronous I/O operation. [Native AIO](./bibtex_ref/nativeAIO) is a set of asynchronous I/O interfaces supported by the kernel, which avoids frequent switching and data copying between user space and the kernel. However, because it requires kernel support, it can only be used on specific operating system architectures and has poor compatibility.

Moreover, compilers and runtime libraries have built a set of independent scheduling systems in user space based on the asynchronous support provided by the operating system. [Stackful coroutine is an independent asynchronous runtime environment built on top of an operating system, which has lower context switching overhead than kernel threads and less invasive impact on the code](./bibtex_ref/revisitingcoroutine). [Stackless coroutines utilize state machines, which are usually automatically generated by the compiler, to share the function stack with the caller, further reducing the overhead of coroutines](./bibtex_ref/survey). [POSIX AIO](./bibtex_ref/posix-aio) is a set of asynchronous I/O interfaces implemented in user space through the POSIX thread interface, which is compatible with different architectures and operating systems that support the POSIX standard. Since the kernel is not aware of asynchronous tasks, there are significant overheads, including thread creation, scheduling, destruction, I/O buffer copying, and context switching cross domain.

Overall, although the kernel has provided some support for user-level asynchronous tasks, it can still only perceive a single listening thread working in the kernel and cannot truly perceive user-level asynchronous tasks, let alone finely allocate system resources according to the workload.

In addition to capturing execution errors in applications, the kernel also needs to handle high-privileged instructions such as device I/O operations. These events are not immediately triggered, thus the kernel also requires a lightweight asynchronous task scheduling mechanism for performance optimization. [LXDs](./bibtex_ref/LXDs) has developed a lightweight asynchronous runtime environment in the kernel for cross-domain batch processing. This runtime environment allows lightweight processes to be created in the kernel that can execute tasks asynchronously, thereby improving system throughput and responsiveness. [Memif](./bibtex_ref/memif) is an operating system service for memory movement that provides a low-latency and low-overhead interface based on asynchronous and hardware-accelerated implementations. [Lee et al.](lee2019asynchronous,.md) significantly improved application performance by reducing I/O latency through the introduction of an asynchronous I/O stack (AIOS) for the kernel. [PM-AIO](./bibtex_ref/Pm-aio) indicates that the Native AIO path appears as a pseudo-asynchronous IO in the PM file system, and true asynchronous AIO is achieved by splitting IO requests into different sub-files. These approaches often propose an asynchronous task scheduling scheme that is independent of the kernel thread scheduler, which lacks generality and scalability and increases the complexity of the kernel.

Based on the above situation, we note that both kernel and user space require asynchronous task scheduling, and the scheduling characteristics are generally similar. Unfortunately, we have not found a unified and modular scheduling framework that can be provided to both user and kernel space.

# 2. Relative Work

This chapter will provide a brief introduction to some of the existing technologies and methodologies used in this paper.

#### Async Support In Rust

In its early stages, Rust supported stackful coroutines. However, to better address issues related to memory leaks and debugging, Rust discontinued support for [stackful coroutines in version 1.0 and instead adopted an asynchronous programming model based on async/await](./bibtex_ref/rust-async). Starting in 2018, Rust began supporting stackless coroutines in its nightly version. In this article, all references to coroutines refer to stackless coroutines.

The Rust compiler has the capability to transform asynchronous functions into coroutines. By using the async/await syntax, the compiler can expand an asynchronous function into a state machine that suspends when the asynchronous operation is not complete and resumes when it is completed. This transformation is performed at compile time, ensuring both efficiency and safety at runtime.

It is worth to note that Rust compiler does not provide an asynchronous runtime, but only provides abstractions such as Future for task management, Waker for asynchronous wakeups, and async/await syntax for transforming functions into state machines. Third-party libraries often leverage these abstractions provided by Rust to implement their own asynchronous runtimes.

![](./Article/assets/rust_async_model.png)

The Rust asynchronous programming model is illustrated in Figure 1.2. First, the user creates a task and adds it to the global task queue. Then, worker threads in the Executor continuously fetch tasks from the task queue and execute them, creating a waker to maintain the task's execution status. When a task needs to wait for an asynchronous event, the waker is placed in the corresponding Reactor for the message and the worker thread executes other tasks. When the asynchronous event arrives in the Reactor, it finds the corresponding waker and uses the wake operation to re-add the corresponding blocking task to the task queue.

#### User-Space Interrupt Support

In traditional operating systems, signals are often transmitted between processes through the kernel. The sending process needs to enter kernel mode to attach the signal to the receiving process, and the performance overhead caused by the privilege level switch can lead to low efficiency. The receiving process often needs to wait until the next scheduling to respond to the signal, which means that the signal cannot be responded to in a timely manner, resulting in high latency. The emergence of user-space interrupt technology has made efficient signal transmission possible.

The term "interrupt" has traditionally been used to describe signals that originate from hardware and are processed in the kernel. Even the software interrupts we commonly use (i.e., signals generated by software) are also processed in the kernel. However, in recent years, a design has emerged that allows tasks in user space to send interrupt signals to each other without going through the kernel, and to process them in user space directly. In 2020, Intel introduced the [x86 user-space interrupt feature](./bibtex_ref/intel-white-paper) in the Sapphire Rapids processor, and in 2021, Linux submitted code for user-space interrupt support in an [RFC patch](./bibtex_ref/uint). Taking user-space signal transmission as an example, we analyze the advantages of user-space interrupts.

In traditional multi-core systems, when user processes running on two cores simultaneously communicate through signals, the sending process needs to enter the kernel to insert the signal into the signal queue of the receiving process, and wait for the receiving process to respond to the signal until it is next scheduled. However, in multi-core systems that support user-space interrupts, the sending process can directly send signals to the receiving process through a hardware interface, and the receiving process can respond immediately when scheduled on the core. In the best case scenario (i.e., when both the sender and receiver are both running on different cores), signal transmission in user-space interrupts does not require entering the kernel, and the receiving end can respond immediately.

# 3. Design

正如第一节中描述的，协程调度机制通常用于用户态，无法从系统层面进行管理。如果想让用户态协程调度机制能够最大限度的发挥其优势，必须要与内核提供的异步 IO 机制结合起来，此外内核往往也需要处理如设备读写等异步任务。因此，内核饱受缺乏轻量级的异步任务调度方案的困扰。

基于目前成熟的条件，我们试图解决上述的困扰。我们将协程引入到内核之中，设计了一套以协程为基本任务的调度系统——共享调度器，从而减少开销，提高系统效率。它具有以下几个特点：

1）统一：将协程引入到内核之后，原本需要使用独立的内核线程才能支持的异步 IO 机制现在能够用轻量级的协程来实现，内核之中所有的任务均以协程的形式存在，而用户态的任务同样以协程的形式存在。这种情况下，内核与用户进程的行为高度统一。

2）共享：一旦引入协程，运行时必不可少，如果使用静态库的形式提供 API，那么每个进程以及内核中都将会存在一份运行时代码，从而造成不必要的内存浪费，因此，我们采用 vDSO 的形式，将内核中的运行时——共享调度器共享给所有用户进程。除此之外，我们定义了优先级调度机制，以共享内存的形式完成对所有进程与内核中协程的优先级的管理。

3）兼容：尽管协程作为基本任务单元，但系统仍然保留了线程相关的系统调用接口，不对原有的系统调用造成影响，能够兼容原来的用户程序。

## 3.1 System Architecture

![](./Article/assets/archtecture.png)

系统架构如上图所示，我们提出了使用带有优先级位图的 Executor 数据结构来管理协程，Executor 维护多个优先级协程队列，存在于各自地址空间内，只能通过共享调度器进行维护（图中①③）。内核以 vDSO 的形式将共享调度器共享给所有用户进程。一旦内核以及用户进程完成初始化之后，它们将执行共享调度器，从各自的 Executor 中取出优先级最高的协程执行，并且完成优先级位图的更新。

## 3.2 局部优先级与全局优先级

Rust 语言提供了 Future 特性，而协程则是实现了 Future 特性的闭包，利用其 async 关键字，创建协程与构造普通函数的工作量相差无几。在此基础上，我们对其进行了扩展，增加 ID 用于标识协程，优先级用于调度顺序，我们称之为协程控制块。

首先，我们在 Executor 中维护了一个局部优先级位图以及多个不同优先级的队列，队列中存储着对应优先级的协程 ID，位图中的某位对应着某个优先级队列是否存在就绪协程。创建、调度以及删除协程会对 Executor 数据结构进行修改。在调度时，根据局部优先级位图，按照优先级顺序依次扫描队列，取出最高优先级的就绪协程执行，从而完成进程或内核内部的协程调度。

而在各个进程以及内核之间，我们仍然需要优先级来描述其先后顺序，因此需要维护一个全局优先级位图。因为用户进程的所有任务都以协程的形式存在，自然而然地可以想到用进程内部所有协程的最高优先级来表示所属进程的优先级，但这却给维护全局位图却带来了困扰。如果为了安全，可以在内核中扫描所有进程的局部优先级位图，而如果为了快速高效，那么通过共享内存的方式无疑是最快速的方式。我们进行了权衡，最终选择了共享内存的方式。

## 3.3 进程、线程与协程

引入协程之后，我们将进程、线程与协程的关系进行了梳理。毫无疑问，协程是任务调度单位，而进程、线程的概念则存在一定变化。首先，将内核视为一个特殊的进程，再加上使用双页表机制，陷入内核和返回用户态均需要切换地址空间，因此进程的职责非常明确，它负责管理地址空间。

而线程的职责则发生较大变化，通常情况下，它不与具体任务进行绑定，只循环执行共享调度器的调度代码，这种情况下创建多个线程是为了让同一个进程能够分配到更多的 CPU 资源。而只在有需要时，线程才会与具体的任务绑定起来，因此，线程的职责是提供一个运行栈。

在界定了概念之间的关系之后，仍然存在某些问题需要解决。通过 3.2 节关于优先级的描述，进程内部协程、进程之间以及内核的调度顺序已经十分明了，但我们尚未谈到切换的问题。协程的切换可以由编译器帮助完成，而进程、线程的切换似乎在新的系统中不相协调。为了解决这个问题，我们在内核中定义了一个特殊的协程——切换协程，顾名思义，它专门用于处于内核与进程之间的切换，通常切换代码没有任何的含义，而此举帮助我们明确了这段代码的定义。它将根据全局优先级位图，选出具有最高优先级的进程，并切换到该进程内部的某个线程，进入用户态。

尽管大多数时刻，线程不与特定任务绑定，但仍然存在着某些特殊情况， 某个协程未被执行完毕，这时协程将与线程进行绑定。因此，线程与协程之间存在着相互影响的关系。我们重新定义了状态转换模型。

### 3.3.1 线程内部协程状态转换

当线程处于就绪和阻塞的状态时，其内部协程的状态不会发生变化。只有在线程处于运行状态，协程才会发生状态转换。通常，线程会由于内核执行了某些处理过程，从阻塞态恢复到就绪态时，线程内部的协程所等待的事件也已经处理完毕，此时协程理应处于就绪的状态，因此，需要用某种方式将协程的状态从阻塞转换为就绪态。我们通过用户态中断完成了这个过程，但是，用户态中断唤醒协程目前的实现实际上是新开了一个线程专门执行唤醒的操作，因此，协程状态发生变化还是在线程处于运行的状态。

协程在创建之后进入就绪态，经过调度转变为运行态；在运行时，当前协程可能会因为等待某一事件而进入到阻塞态，也可能因为检测到存在其他优先级而让权，也可能会执行完毕进入退出状态；当协程处于阻塞的状态时，这时只能等待某个事件发生之后被唤醒从而进入就绪的状态。

### 3.3.2 线程状态转换

见上图，它不仅仅描述了线程内部的协程状态模型，同时还描述了线程状态模型以及线程、协程状态转换的相互影响关系。从图中我们可以观察到，线程仍然具有创建、就绪、阻塞、运行和结束五种状态，其状态转换与上述线程内部协程状态转换类似。需要注意的是，尽管从内核的视角看来，造成线程发生状态转移的事件仍然是调度、让权、等待以及唤醒这几类。但是，线程内部的协程状态转换给这几类事件增加了新的起因。因此，造成线程状态变化的原因具体可划分为以下几类：
1. 与内部协程无关的外部事件。例如，无论内部的协程处于何种状态，都会因为时钟中断被抢占进入就绪态。
2. 与内部协程相关的外部事件。由于内核执行了某些处理过程，完成了线程内部协程所等待的事件，使得协程需要被重新调度，线程将会从阻塞态转换为就绪态。
3. 内部协程自身状态变化。一方面是协程主动让权，当上一个执行完毕的协程处于就绪或阻塞态，需要调度下一个协程时，若此时检测出其他进程内存在更高优先级的协程，这时会导致线程让权进入就绪态；另一方面是协程执行过程中产生了异常，导致线程进入阻塞态，等待内核处理异常。

除了在概念以及模型上的变化之外，在实际项目中，我们并未对系统调用的语义做出任何变化，保留了线程相关的系统调用，能够兼容多线程模型的用户程序，并且没有增加开销。

# 4. Implementation

This chapter elaborates some implementation details regarding the shared scheduler.

<!-- ### 4.1 Global priority and local priority. （放在 design 中）

In the shared scheduler, each process (with the kernel as a special process) maintains a coroutine queue, and each coroutine has its own priority. We consider the highest priority within a process as the priority of this process. Additionally, a global priority array is maintained in the system to record the priorities of all processes. The global priority is used to select the appropriate process for scheduling coroutines. When a process is selected for execution, using `poll` as the entry function will select the highest priority coroutine within that process for execution.coroutine within that process for execution.

![](./Article/assets/gloabl&local_prio.png)

It is important to consider the timing of updating local and global priorities. The following are some important timing considerations for updating priorities:

- **coroutine spawn**: When a new coroutine is added to the ready queue, it is important to update the local priority bitmap and to check for any changes in the highest priority. If the highest priority has changed, the global priority array should be updated accordingly.
- **fetch**: When a coroutine is removed from the ready queue, it is important to update the local priority bitmap accordingly. Since the coroutine has not yet started its execution, there is no need to update the global priority array.
- **re_back**: When a coroutine in pending state is awakened, it is important to check and update the local priority bitmap, and to check for any changes in the highest priority. If the highest priority has changed, the global priority array should be updated accordingly. -->

### 4.1 Asynchronous system calls

Synchronous system calls, such as "read", block the entire thread. In a fully asynchronous coroutine programming environment, it is necessary to transform system calls into asynchronous operations to ensure that they only block the current coroutine at most. The support for asynchronous system calls mainly involves two parts: user space and kernel space.

#### User Space

The modification of the user space system call interface to support asynchronous calls needs to consider both functional differences and formal consistency. There should be an effort to minimize the differences from synchronous system calls. Additionally, automation should be considered throughout the modification process.

To enable system calls to support asynchronous features, an `AsyncCall` auxiliary data structure needs to be added, and the Future trait should be implemented for it according to Rust language requirements. After completing this work, the `await` keyword can be used when calling system calls.

The formal differences should be minimized as much as possible. We use Rust language procedural macros to generate both synchronous and asynchronous system calls. Finally, synchronous and asynchronous system calls achieve a high degree of consistency in the form, with the only difference being the parameters. The format is shown in the table below.

```rust
#[async_fn(true)] 
pub fn read(fd: usize, buffer: &mut [u8], key: usize, cid: usize) -> isize {
	sys_read(fd, buffer.as_mut_ptr() as usize, buffer.len(), key, cid) 
}

#[async_fn]
pub fn write(fd: usize, buffer: &[u8], key: usize, cid: usize) -> isize { 
	sys_write(fd, buffer.as_ptr() as usize, buffer.len(), key, cid) 
}

read_fd!(fd, buffer, key, current_cid); // async call
read_fd!(fd, buffer); // sync call
```

#### Kernel Space

In addition to ensuring formal consistency in the user-level system call interface, we also aim for consistency in the kernel system call processing interface. Ultimately, the kernel determines whether to execute synchronous or asynchronous processing logic based on the system call parameters. In the case of asynchronous processing, the kernel uses some method to immediately return the task to user space without waiting for the corresponding processing flow to complete synchronously. Once the kernel completes the corresponding asynchronous processing, it wakes up the corresponding user-level coroutine.

For instance, the following diagram illustrates the entire process of an asynchronous system call for socket read operation. After entering the kernel, if an asynchronous process is executed, the synchronous process in the kernel is encapsulated into a kernel coroutine, which is then added to the kernel executor. The process then returns to user space and generates a future to wait for the waking up of the user coroutine that executes the asynchronous system call. The user's executor then switches to execute the next user coroutine. After the asynchronous system call returns to user space, the kernel's processing flow is encapsulated into a coroutine, but it is not executed. The coroutine waits for the network driver to notify the kernel after the data is ready, and then the kernel coroutine is awakened to execute the corresponding processing. Once the kernel finishes the processing (in this case, copying data to the user space buffer), it generates a user space interrupt, passing the ID of the corresponding coroutine to be awakened. The user space interrupt handler then wakes up the corresponding coroutine.

### 4.2 Completely asynchronous scheduling environment

To achieve better uniformity in coroutine scheduling, we have carried out compatibility adaptations on the previously Unix-like runtime environments in both user mode and kernel mode. We have provided a completely asynchronous scheduling environment for both user and kernel modes.

In user mode, each process will be initialized using the shared scheduler environment initialization function. After initialization, the main function provided by the user program will be encapsulated into an asynchronous coroutine (which is equivalent to a synchronous task that cannot be awaited) and added to the ready queue for unified scheduling. In the end, all tasks in user mode are executed under the scheduling of the shared scheduler.

In kernel mode, the original scheduling task used to schedule user-mode processes is also encapsulated as a kernel scheduling coroutine, which participates in scheduling along with other ordinary kernel coroutines.Since the scheduling of user processes is synchronous, when encapsulating it as a scheduling coroutine, it is necessary to manually block and switch to other kernel coroutines.

### 4.3 How to share scheduler code between kernel and user mode

- 局部优先级和全局优先级。
- 异步系统调用实现
  - 接口改造
  - 异步系统调用的唤醒机制实现（结合用户态中断）。
- 兼容性实现
  - 用户态的代码入口为调度器初始化代码，为用户提供完全异步的环境。
  - 内核态的线程调度和协程调度的统一。
- 模块化调度器，用vdso在用户态和内核态复用了同一套调度代码。

# 4. Performance Evaluation

To demonstrate the lower switching overhead of coroutine programming model compared to thread programming model, we constructed two different TcpServer models using coroutine and thread respectively to test the server's throughput, message latency, and latency jitter.

In addition, we will demonstrate the significant role of priority in ensuring the real-time performance of certain specific tasks under limited resources by analyzing the impact of coroutine priority on task throughput, message latency, and latency jitter in the TcpServer experiment.

We implemented the shared scheduler based on rCore, which is a small operating system almost entirely written in Rust, characterized by its compactness and efficiency. It can also fully leverage Rust's support for asynchronous programming to quickly implement the shared scheduler.(需要介绍用户态中断的硬件环境)

 The Msg Sender in the client periodically sends a certain length of data to the server, while the Msg Recv in the client receives the server's response, calculates the response latency, and waits for the timer to expire before sending the next request. Each connection in the server consists of three components:

- Msg Recv, which receives requests from the client and stores them in the request queue..
- Msg Server, which takes messages from the request message queue, performs matrix operations, and sends the results to the response message queue.
- Msg Sender, which takes responses from the response message queue and send them to the client.

These three components transfer data through a shared message buffer.

## 4.1 Coroutine programming model vs. thread programming model

To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the coroutine and thread programming models, as well as the switching overhead between them, we implemented the three components of the Server Process using the thread model and the coroutine model respectively. We represent the test results for processing 1 × 1 matrix requests in the thread model as Thread-1, and the test results for processing 20 × 20 matrix requests in the coroutine model as Coroutine-20. Similarly, the other results are represented accordingly. The experiments were conducted on 4 physical CPUs, with the server allocating 4 virtual CPUs. The client sent requests at a frequency of 100ms.

The test results for message latency are shown in the following figure. As can be seen from the figure, the thread model has similar or even slightly lower message latency than the coroutine model when the number of connections is small. This is because when the number of connections is small, the kernel can directly schedule threads to execute tasks, while the coroutine model adds an extra layer of synchronization and mutual exclusion operations in the scheduler, resulting in slightly higher latency. As the number of connections increases, the delay of the thread model rapidly increases and is much higher than that of the coroutine model. This is because most coroutine switches do not need to trap into the kernel, only switching the function stack, resulting in much smaller switching overhead than threads. Comparing different matrix request sizes under the same model, it is found that the larger the matrix size, the higher the latency, which is due to the larger overhead of message sending and receiving and message processing for larger matrix requests, leading to an expected increase in latency.

![](./Article/assets/compare_thread_coroutine.png)

The figure also shows the test results of the total throughput for different matrix request sizes under different models. It can be seen that the total throughput of the server under the coroutine model increases linearly with the increase of the number of connections, even when the matrix request size increases. Since the load has not reached the peak (the client sends a request every 100ms, and the highest latency shown in the figure is only 10ms), the throughput depends on the number of connections and the client's request frequency. For the server under the thread model, it can keep up with the coroutine model when the number of connections is small, but as the number of connections increases, the switching overhead increases rapidly, leading to a slowing down of the total throughput increase trend. As for Thread-20, the load almost reaches its peak when the number of connections is around 64.

## 2.2 Priority-controlled resource allocation

In computer systems, both CPU and IO resources are always limited. Under such resource constraints, we can prioritize certain services by setting their priority levels. In the context of a TcpServer, we can set the priority levels of each connection in a hierarchical manner to ensure lower latency and reduced latency jitter for certain connections.

Our experiments were conducted on four physical CPUs. The clients sent request messages with a matrix size of 20x20 at a frequency of 50ms. The server was implemented using coroutines. We established 128 connections between the clients and server, divided equally among 8 priority levels, and tested the performance of the connections with different priority levels under different numbers of virtual CPU.

The test results are shown in the figure below, where "x-core" in the legend represents the number of virtual CPU cores allocated to the server. The results indicate that under resource constraints, only connections with higher priority levels (lower priority numbers) are able to achieve higher throughput and lower request latency. With the increase in resource quantity, the system is able to ensure that connections with lower priority levels also achieve higher throughput and lower latency, while still adhering to the requirement that the highest priority level has the highest throughput and lowest latency. Furthermore, we also observed that with the increase in virtual cores, there was a slight performance degradation for high-priority connections. This is due to the increased synchronization and mutual exclusion among poll threads in the scheduler caused by the increase in virtual cores. In the future, this issue can be alleviated by introducing multi-level ready queues.

![](./Article/assets/connect_with_prio.png)

We further analyzed the distribution of message latency for each priority level, as shown in the figure below. This largely conforms to the characteristics of prioritizing high-priority connections in request handling.

# 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a general and user/kernel-space shared asynchronous scheduling framework called the shared scheduler. We introduce the concept of coroutine into the kernel as a scheduling unit, reducing context switching overhead and improving system resource utilization. And we have designed an $O(1)$ complexity priority scheduling algorithm based on the priority of each coroutine. Finally, we implement asynchronous system calls using user-space interrupts to reduce the overhead of kernel-space context switching. In the scenario of TcpServer, the server implemented by the shared scheduler exhibits lower context switching overhead and higher resource utilization.
